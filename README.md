# Fruit Fighters RPG Game

A simple game in which the user selects one of four fruits as their "fruit fighter" in an effort to defeat the remaining three fruits. 

The mechanics are basic: 

* Whenever you click `attack`, your fruit fighter damages the opponent. The opponent will lose health. Each fruit has unique `health` and `attack` powers. 
* The opponent will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, your fruit fighter will lose some of its health, but it will increase its `attack` power by its base `attack` value. Each fruit has a unique `counter-attack` value, which doesn't change.
* You must keep hitting the `attack` button in order to defeat your opponent.
* Defeated opponents will populate the graveyard one-by-one until you emerge victorious! Be careful not to get turned into jam.
